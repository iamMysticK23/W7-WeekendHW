WEATHER APP 

Notes:
I wanted to come up with some kind of unique design so i used Figma to design a mock up.
Included this file for reference if needed.
I then Bootstrap 5'd the design so it would look aesthetically pleasing.

- Additions:
I added extra weather data to display in the Today's Forecast area.
I also added little icons that change dependent on the weather data.
Added some colors to make text easier to read
    - I used if/else statements to do this
